# AfterQC
Automatic Filtering, Trimming, Error Removing and Quality Control for fastq data   
`AfterQC` can simply go through all fastq files in a folder and then output three folders: <b>good</b>, <b>bad</b> and <b>QC</b> folders, which contains good reads, bad reads and the QC results of each fastq file/pair.   
Currently it supports processing data from HiSeq 2000/2500/3000/4000, Nextseq 500/550, MiniSeq...and other [Illumina 1.8 or newer formats](http://support.illumina.com/help/SequencingAnalysisWorkflow/Content/Vault/Informatics/Sequencing_Analysis/CASAVA/swSEQ_mCA_FASTQFiles.htm)   

The author has reimplemented this tool in C++ with multithreading support to make it much faster. The new tool is called `fastp` and can be found at: https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp . If you prefer a C++ based tool, please use `fastp` instead.   

# An Example of Report
The report of AfterQC is a single HTML page with figures contained in. See an example: [http://opengene.org/AfterQC/report.html](http://opengene.org/AfterQC/report.html)

# Features:
`AfterQC` does following tasks automatically:  
* Filters reads with too low quality, too short length or too many N
* Filters reads with abnormal PolyA/PolyT/PolyC/PolyG sequences
* Does per-base quality control and plots the figures
* Trims reads at front and tail, according to QC results
* For pair-end sequencing data, `AfterQC` automatically corrects low quality wrong bases in overlapped area of read1/read2
* Detects and eliminates bubble artifact caused by sequencer due to fluid dynamics issues
* Single molecule barcode sequencing support: if all reads have a single molecule barcode (see duplex sequencing), `AfterQC` shifts the barcodes from the reads to the fastq query names
* Support both single-end sequencing and pair-end sequencing data
* Automatic adapter cutting for pair-end sequencing data
* Sequencing error estimation, and error distribution profiling

# Get AfterQC
* with bioconda `conda install afterqc`
* latest: `git clone https://github.com/OpenGene/AfterQC.git` or download [https://github.com/OpenGene/AfterQC/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/OpenGene/AfterQC/archive/master.zip)
* stable: [Releases](https://github.com/OpenGene/AfterQC/releases)

# PyPy suggestion:
`AfterQC` is compitable with `PyPy`. Using `PyPy` to run `AfterQC` is strongly suggested since it can make `AfterQC` 3X faster than native Python (CPython).  To run with `pypy`, just replace `python` with `pypy` in the commands.

# Simple usage:
* Prepare your fastq files in a folder
* For single-end sequencing, the filenames in the folder should be `*R1*`, otherwise you should specify `--read1_flag`
* For pair-end sequencing, the filenames in the folder should be `*R1*` and `*R2*`, otherwise you should specify `--read1_flag` and `--read2_flag`
```shell
cd /path/to/fastq/folder
python path/to/AfterQC/after.py
```
* three folders will be automatically generated, a folder `good` stores the good reads, a folder `bad` stores the bad reads and a folder `QC` stores the report of quality control
* `AfterQC` will print some statistical information after it is done, such how many good reads, how many bad reads, and how many reads are corrected.
* if you want to run `AfterQC` only with a single file/pair:
```shell
# with a single file
python after.py -1 R1.fq

# with a single pair
python after.py -1 R1.fq -2 R2.fq
```

# Quality Control only
If you only want to get quality control statistics, run:  
```shell
python after.py --qc_only
```

# Gzip output
* If the input FastQ files are gzipped, then the output will be also gzipped.   
* If the input FastQ files are not gzipped, you can enable `--gzip` or `-z` option to force gzip compression.
* Use `--compression` to change the compression level (0~9), default is 2. The better the compression, the lower the speed.

                        read/pair is bad. Default 0 means do not filter reads
                        by low quality base count

```
***Debubble options (not suggested for regular tasks)***    
If you want to eliminate bubble artifact, turn debubble option on (this is slow, usually you don't need to do this): 
```
  --debubble            enable debubble algorithm to remove the
                        reads in the bubbles. Default is False
  --debubble_dir=DEBUBBLE_DIR

                        specify the name flag of a barcoded file, default is
                        barcode, which means a file with name *barcode* is a
                        barcoded file
  --barcode=BARCODE     specify whether deal with barcode sequencing files,
                        default is on, which means all files with barcode_flag
                        in filename will be treated as barcode sequencing
                        files
```
***QC options***
```shell
  --qc_only             enable this option, only QC result will be output, this
                        can be much faster
  --qc_sample=QC_SAMPLE
                        sample up to qc_sample when do QC, default is 1000,000
  --qc_kmer=QC_KMER     specify the kmer length for KMER statistics for QC,

```
                        
# Understand the report
* `AfterQC` will generate a QC folder, which contains lots of figures. 
* For pair-end sequencing data, both read1 and read2 figures will be in the same folder with the folder name of read1's filename. `R1` means `read1`, `R2` means `read2`.
* For single-end sequencing data, it will still have `R1`.
* `prefilter` means `before filtering`, `postfilter` means `after filtering`
* For pair-end sequencing data, `After` will do an `overlap analysis`. read1 and read2 will be overlapped when `read1_length + read2_length > DNA_template_length`.

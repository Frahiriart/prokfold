afterqc quality base (-q):		15
afterqc poly size limit (-p):	35
afterqc poly mismatch (-a):	2
afterqc N base limit (-n):		3
afterqc seq length (-s):		35



### Bowtie2 ###

bowtie num of align (-k): None	# Positive number if you want use this param unless type "None"
bowtie number cpu (-p): 1	# Pipeline more efficient if number of cpu given to pipeline is divisible by this number 



### Deeptools ###

#Type None for no normalisation or type BPM, TPM, RPKM, CPM
bamCoverage normalize: rpkm

# 0 mean that you don't make filtering with this parameter
plotCoverage min mapping quality (--minMappingQuality): 0

### FeatureCounts ###

#list of all feature that you search
#To have all feature in gff type the command above
#cut -f 2 directory/genome.gff3 | sort| uniq -c |sort -nr
featCount feature type (-t): CDS,ncRNA,tRNA,regulatory_region,tmRNA,rRNA,exon


### Fadu ###

#list of all feature that you search
#To have all feature in gff type the command above
#cut -f 2 directory/genome.gff3 | sort| uniq -c |sort -nr
fadu feature type (-f): CDS,ncRNA,tRNA,regulatory_region,tmRNA,rRNA,exon

#Remove the reads that are mapped to multiple region of the genome (True or False)
remove multi-mapped (-M): true

#Keep only properly paired reads (true or false)
proper pairs (-p): true

#if the fragment size of properly-paired reads exceeds this value, 
#it will process pair as single reads (in default put 1000)
max fragment size (-m): 1000

### EdgeR ###

# You can choose between "TMM","RLE","upperquartile","none"
normalization method (-n):	TMM

# Minimum number of count for a feature in one sample to validate the test
minimum count per sample (-c):	4

# Minimum number of sample which need to validate the "minimum count per sample"
# you can use a number (example: 3) or a percentage (example: 0.4)
# We advice to don't exceed the number of sample in group with the less sample
# The percentage will round up in function of the number of sample
minimum number of sample (-s):	0.375

# Number of feature selected with highest Fold Change
top Fold Change heatmap(-t):	30
